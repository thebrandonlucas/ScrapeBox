                        In my Junior and Senior years of high school, I had the opportunity to intern at Georgia Tech's Pathology Dynamics
                        lab under the direction of Dr. Cassie Mitchell. There I had my first introduction to programming, and developed a passion
                        for the study of neurodegenerative disease.
